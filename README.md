# OFGummiShip
Arcade style shooting game in the style of Kingdom Hearts. Take control of a Gummiship and blast your way through heartless ships and bosses. Built using the Openframeworks library as opposed to my old project using SFML.

## Movement & Actions
- WASD or Arrow Keys or Click&Drag to move the ship
- Hold SPACE to fire lasers

## Gameplay
Move the ship around to position it for shooting enemies or maneuvering around obstacles. Difficulty and enemy health will increase as the game progresses. Colliding with enemy ships, obstacles, or projectiles will reduce lives by 1.

### To Be Added
- Stamina Bar
- Dodge roll when stamina bar is full
- New enemy types (small ships and bosses)
- New levels
- Navigation menus for level selection/starting game
- Display previous highscore at end screen
- UI improvements
